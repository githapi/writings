Recently I have been working with electron impact excitation cross sections and electron impact excitation rate coefficients via python. I started working with cross sections from the LXCat database (https://us.lxcat.net/data/set_processes.php) using Oleg Zatsarinny database for electron impact excitation cross section for Ar I ground state (gs) to the 2p1 (13.48 eV) level (Paschen not.), and Tobin Weber's cross sections for Ar I gs to 3p1 (14.738 eV) level.
Zatsarinny's cross section has been calculate using the B-spline R-matrix method for atomic processes. Weber utilises a method where the fluorescence from the decay of the excited atoms to the levels of 3‚Å¢ùëù5-‚Å¢4‚Å¢ùë† configuration is used via which the optical-emission cross sections are determined (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.68.032719), the data for which is available on LXCat website under the IST-Lisbon . 
Using the two cross sections and determining the excitation coefficients for electron imapct process, it was found that the excitation coefficient can be well approximated as an exponential function of electron temperature, a*exp(-E/T). Here E ~ E_ij**2.519. All of this is valid using a Maxwellian electron energy distribution function in the low-temperature range of 0-4 (eV).
