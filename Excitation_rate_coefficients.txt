Recently I have been working with electron impact excitation cross sections and electron impact excitation rate coefficients via python. I started working with cross sections from the LXCat database (https://us.lxcat.net/data/set_processes.php) using Oleg Zatsarinny database for electron impact excitation cross section for Ar I ground state (gs) to the 2p1 (13.48 eV) level (Paschen not.), and Tobin Weber's cross sections for Ar I gs to 3p1 (14.738 eV) level.
Zatsarinny's cross section has been calculate using the B-spline R-matrix method for atomic processes. Weber utilises a method where the fluorescence from the decay of the excited atoms to the levels of 3‚Å¢ùëù5‚Å¢4‚Å¢ùë† configuration is used via which the optical-emission cross sections are determined (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.68.032719), the data for which is available on LXCat website under the IST-Lisbon . Using these two
